For over 50 years now, scientists have known that, despite their reputation, not all fish are 
cold-blooded. Some shark and tuna species, the white shark and the Atlantic bluefin tuna, have 
evolved the ability to warm parts of their bodies, such as their muscle, eyes and brain.

About 35 species of fishes – accounting for less than 0.1% of all described fishes – have this 
ability, which allows them to stay warmer than the water around them. Until recently, however, 
the reason this ability evolved was a mystery.

Some scientists believed being warm-blooded allowed the fish to swim faster, as warmer muscles 
tend to be more powerful. Others thought it allowed them to live in a broader range of temperatures, 
making them less susceptible to the effects of ocean warming caused by climate change. With this in 
mind, an international team of marine biologists and I set out to answer the puzzle of why some fish 
warm-blooded when most aren’t.

Our study found fishes’ ability to warm their bodies provides competitive advantages – they can
 swim faster than their cold-blooded relatives. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be 
 able to adapt to changing ocean temperatures under climate change better than cold-blooded fish, 
 according to our results.
